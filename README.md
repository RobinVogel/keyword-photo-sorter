# keyword-photo-sorter

Python script to quickly sort photos by looking at them and pressing a keyboard key.
Rough on the edges but does the job.

Start it in a folder with pictures that one wants to sort, and press keypad
numbers to assign it to any of the folders passed to the argument `--folders`.

Uses pygame.
